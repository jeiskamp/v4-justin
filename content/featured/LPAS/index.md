Unfortunately this is a private application intended for business use. This project includes 15+ custom automation tools. Each tool allows users to upload a set of data, these datasets could come from multiple .xlsx files, sheets within those files, or .csv files. Each custom tool would then aggregate the needed data, process and format to final output files which users would then download to use accordingly. Over the lifetime of these tools it has saved users 100s of hours of manual data processing.
